## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Over all this project gave me a complete understading on how to pull specific data set from a raw file of data just compiled as a whole. Also gave me a good understanding on how to use the pivot table to my advange being such a powerful too to be able to create charts and get a better understanding of what i am looking at and better pair categories. As well as being able to visualize the data by putting the data from the pivot into a chart and getting the clear picture.
## Analysis 
Over all it really made me think about the steps i had to take to get to the right answer. Not only knowing what i had to get acompplished for the assigment but also having a strategy on how i was going to get thet assigment completed.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of my biggest challenges was getting the pivot table to work correctly. Some of the mistakes i was making was not having the right value in the columns, so at the same time i kept getting faulty data back.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Per the data i can see that during the month of may more people are going to the theater and are willing so spend more money in these kinds of situation. Probalby correlade with summer break. Really starts dropping off during the winter.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Looks like plays are not a very popular category. Data suggest that as it get's more expensive the less likely people will spend money on it. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Not sure on limitation, for the challenge this seems to pull all the data necessary to be able to be completed.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A bar graph can defiently be another option to ilustrate the required infomation that the challenge was requesting.
