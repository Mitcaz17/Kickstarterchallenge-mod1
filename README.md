## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Over all this project gave me a complete understading on how to pull specific data set from a raw file of data just compiled as a whole. Also gave me a good understanding on how to use the pivot table to my advange being such a powerful too to be able to create charts and get a better understanding of what i am looking at and better pair categories. As well as being able to visualize the data by putting the data from the pivot into a chart and getting the clear picture.
